    <br>  <h2> <b> About this Agreement </b></h2>

    <p> <b>Modifying this Agreement: </b>
      We may modify this Agreement at any time, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Continuation of this Agreement: </b>
      If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “About Software in the Service”;
      “Other Legal Terms”, and “About This Agreement”.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Severance: </b>
      If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.
    </p>

    <p> <b>No Waiver: </b>
      If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights
      that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Interpretation: </b>
      In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative
      purposes.
    </p>

    <p> <b>DISPUTES: </b>
    <b> Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any SOWHAT VOTE LLC Service, or to any services sold by SOWHAT VOTE LLC
      will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. </b> The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply
      to this agreement.
    </p>

    <p> <b>
      There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on
      an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and
      must follow the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would.
    </b>  </p>

    <p>
      To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent
      - LEGALINC CORPORATE SERVICES INC., 5830 E 2nd St Ste 8, Casper, WY 82609.  The arbitration will be conducted by the
      American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
      The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
      AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at another
      mutually agreed location.
    </p>

    <p>
      We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
      consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any
      right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
      intellectual property rights.
    </p>

    <p> <b>LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION: </b>
      YOU AND SOWHAT VOTE LLC AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR
      AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
    </p>

    <p> <b>GOVERNING LAW: </b>
      By using any SOWHAT VOTE LLC Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state
      of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Service and any dispute of any sort that
      might arise between you and SOWHAT VOTE LLC. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, then it will be
      litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of the state of Delaware, USA. You and SOWHAT VOTE LLC consent to personal
      jurisdiction in those courts.
    </p>
