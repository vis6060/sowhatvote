 <br> <h2 style="text-align:center;"> <b> Business and Industrial Loans </b> </h2> <br>

<p> The purpose of the Business & Industrial (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program is to improve, develop, or finance business, industry, and employment and improve the economic and environmental climate in rural communities.
<br> <p> This purpose is achieved by bolstering the existing private credit structure through the guarantee of quality loans which will <b>provide lasting community benefits.</b>  </p>

<br> <h3> Eligibility: </h3>
<br> <p> A borrower may be: </p>
<ol> <li>  An individual </li>
  <li> A cooperative organization, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity organized and operated on a profit or nonprofit basis </li>
  <li> An Indian tribe on a Federal or state reservation or other Federally recognized tribal group, or </li>
  <li> A public body. </li> </ol>

<br> <p>  A borrower must be engaged in or proposing to engage in a business that will: </p>
<ol> <li> Provide employment </li>
  <li> Improve the economic or environmental climate </li>
  <li>Promote the conservation, development, and use of water for aquaculture, or </li>
  <li> Reduce reliance on nonrenewable energy resources by encouraging the development and construction of renewable energy systems. </li>
  <li> Individual borrowers must be citizens of the United States or reside in the U.S. after being legally admitted for permanent residence. Corporations or other non-public body organization-type borrowers must be at least 51 percent owned by persons who are either citizens of the U.S. or reside in the U.S. after being legally admitted for permanent residence. B&I loans are normally available in rural areas. </li> </ol>

<br> <h3> Loan terms </h3>
<p> The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated between the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or variable as long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates are subject to Agency review and approval. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different intervals during the term of the loan, but the adjustments may not be more often than quarterly. <br>
  <br>  The annual renewal fee is paid once a year and is required to maintain the enforceability of the guarantee as to the lender. There is also an upfront guarantee fee of three percent. A limited amount of loans may be guaranteed with a two percent fee, subject to meeting regulatory requirements. <br>
  <br>  The maximum repayment for loans on real estate will not exceed 30 years; machinery and equipment repayment will not exceed the useful life of the machinery and equipment purchased with loan funds or 15 years, whichever is less; and working capital repayment will not exceed seven years. <br>
  <br>  The total amount of Agency loans to one borrower must not exceed $10 million. The Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception to the $10 million limit for loans of $25 million under certain circumstances. The Secretary may approve guaranteed loans in excess of $25 million, up to $40 million, for rural cooperative organizations that process value-added agricultural commodities. <br>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Medicare Prescription Drug Plans </b></h2><br>

    <p>Medicare offers prescription drug coverage to everyone with Medicare.  </p>
    <br><p>If you decide not to join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) when you're first eligible, and you don't have other creditable prescription drug coverage, or you don't get Extra Help, you'll likely pay a late enrollment penalty.

    To get Medicare drug coverage, you must join a plan run by an insurance company or other private company approved by Medicare. Each plan can vary in cost and drugs covered.

    There are two ways to get drug coverage: </p>

    <ol> <li> A Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D)   </li>
<li> A Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C), like an HMO or PPO, or other Medicare health plan that offers Medicare prescription drug coverage. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Visit Medicare.gov for more information on these two options, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <ul> <li> There are specific times when you can sign up for these plans, or make changes to coverage you already have. Generally, you can join, switch, or drop a Medicare drug plan: When you first become eligible for Medicare because you’re turning or turned 65. You can sign up for a Medicare drug plan during your Initial Enrollment Period – the 7-month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. If you sign up during the first 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, in most cases, your coverage starts the first day of your birthday month. However, if your birthday is on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the prior month. If you enroll the month you turn 65 or during the last 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, the start date for your coverage will be delayed.  </li>
    <li>If you get Part B for the first time during the General Enrollment Period, you can also join a Medicare drug plan from April 1 – June 30. Your coverage will start on July 1.</li>
<li>During open enrollment, between October 15 - December 7 each year. Your coverage will begin on January 1 of the following year, as long as the plan gets your request during Open Enrollment.</li>
   <li>At any time, if you qualify for Extra Help. Extra Help is a Medicare program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance.</li>
   <li>When certain events happen in your life, like if you move or you lose other insurance coverage. These chances to make changes are called Special Enrollment Periods (SEPs). Rules about when you can make changes and the type of changes you can make are different for each SEP.</li>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> 7(a) Small Business Loan </b></h2><br>

    <p> 7(a) loans are the most basic and most used type loan of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) business loan programs. </p>
    <br><p>Its name comes from section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, which authorizes the agency to provide business loans to American small businesses. The loan program is designed to assist for-profit businesses that are not able to get other financing from other resources. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>

All businesses that are considered for financing under SBA's 7(a) loan program must: meet SBA size standards, be for-profit, not already have the internal resources (business or personal) to provide the financing, and be able to demonstrate repayment. Certain variations of SBA's 7(a) loan program may also require additional eligibility criteria. Special purpose programs will identify those additional criteria.  </p>

    <ol> <li>


    </li> </ol>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
   <p> The maximum length of the loan is 25 years for real estate and seven years for working capital. The maximum loan amount is $2 million.</p>
