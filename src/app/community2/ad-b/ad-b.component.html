    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Stafford Loans for Students </b></h2><br>

    <p> Direct Stafford Loans, from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, are low-interest loans for eligible students to help cover the cost of higher education at a four-year college or university, community college, or trade, career, or technical school.Eligible students borrow directly from the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) at participating schools. </p>
    <br><p>Stafford Loans are available for undergraduate and graduate students and come from Direct Stafford Loans made by the U.S. Department of Education. You will repay a Federal Direct Stafford Loan to the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
<p>A subsidized loan is awarded on the basis of financial need, as determined by the information you submit on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). If you are eligible for a subsidized Stafford loan you will not be charged interest while you are in school on an at least half-time basis, during a grace period of up to six months after you are no longer enrolled on at least a "half-time" basis, or during certain defined deferment periods. The Federal government pays (subsidizes) the interest during these periods.</p>
<p>An unsubsidized loan is not awarded on the basis of need. But you still must apply using the FAFSA. For unsubsidized loans, you will be charged interest from the time the loan is disbursed until it is paid off in full. However, you can choose to defer payment of interest while you are in school and during any grace or deferment period. However, if you allow interest to accrue (accumulate) during these periods, it will be capitalized. This means that interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan, and additional interest will be based on that higher amount.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>To qualify for this program, you must be enrolled in a postsecondary educational program leading to a postsecondary degree or certificate. There are other requirements. For more information, read The Student Guide online at https://studentaid.ed.gov/resources#funding.  </p>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p> Maximum Loan Amount: up to $20,500 annually (depending on your grade level, your status as a dependent or independent student, your status as an undergraduate or a graduate student, and your total cost of attendance).</p>
<p> Interest Rate: The interest rate is variable (adjusted annually on July 1st) but does not exceed 8.25 percent. You'll be notified any time the variable rate changes. </p>
   <p>Maximum Loan Length: 30 years, depending on amount borrowed and repayment plan chosen. There are a number of repayment plans offered through the Direct programs.</p>
    <p>Frequency of Payments: monthly or quarterly. After you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment, you have a six-month grace period before you begin repayment.</p>
<p>Prepayment Penalties: none</p>
    <p>Fees: You'll pay a fee of up to four percent of the loan, deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement. Because of this deduction, you'll receive slightly less than the amount you're borrowing.</p>

    <br><h3>Apply Process</h3>
<p> To apply for Direct Stafford Loans, fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You can apply online using FAFSA on the Web at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa (the faster and easier way), or you can get a paper FAFSA from your high school, local library, postsecondary school, or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243). TTY users for the hearing impaired can call 1-847-688-2567.</p>
<p>If you applied for Federal student aid for the previous school year, you can probably file a Renewal FAFSA for the next year. By using a Renewal FAFSA, you will only have to update any information that has changed and fill in a few new answers. </p>

    <p>Medicare offers prescription drug coverage to everyone with Medicare.  </p>
    <br><p>If you decide not to join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) when you're first eligible, and you don't have other creditable prescription drug coverage, or you don't get Extra Help, you'll likely pay a late enrollment penalty.

    To get Medicare drug coverage, you must join a plan run by an insurance company or other private company approved by Medicare. Each plan can vary in cost and drugs covered.

    There are two ways to get drug coverage: </p>

    <ol> <li> A Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D)   </li>
<li> A Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C), like an HMO or PPO, or other Medicare health plan that offers Medicare prescription drug coverage. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Visit Medicare.gov for more information on these two options, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <ul> <li> There are specific times when you can sign up for these plans, or make changes to coverage you already have. Generally, you can join, switch, or drop a Medicare drug plan: When you first become eligible for Medicare because you’re turning or turned 65. You can sign up for a Medicare drug plan during your Initial Enrollment Period – the 7-month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. If you sign up during the first 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, in most cases, your coverage starts the first day of your birthday month. However, if your birthday is on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the prior month. If you enroll the month you turn 65 or during the last 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, the start date for your coverage will be delayed.  </li>
    <li>If you get Part B for the first time during the General Enrollment Period, you can also join a Medicare drug plan from April 1 – June 30. Your coverage will start on July 1.</li>
<li>During open enrollment, between October 15 - December 7 each year. Your coverage will begin on January 1 of the following year, as long as the plan gets your request during Open Enrollment.</li>
   <li>At any time, if you qualify for Extra Help. Extra Help is a Medicare program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance.</li>
   <li>When certain events happen in your life, like if you move or you lose other insurance coverage. These chances to make changes are called Special Enrollment Periods (SEPs). Rules about when you can make changes and the type of changes you can make are different for each SEP.</li>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> 7(a) Small Business Loan </b></h2><br>

    <p> 7(a) loans are the most basic and most used type loan of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) business loan programs. </p>
    <br><p>Its name comes from section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, which authorizes the agency to provide business loans to American small businesses. The loan program is designed to assist for-profit businesses that are not able to get other financing from other resources.
    This is the best option when real estate is part of a business purchase, but it can also be used for: Short- and long-term working capital; Refinance current business debt; Purchase furniture, fixtures, and supplies</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>SBA provides loans to businesses - not individuals - so the requirements of eligibility are based on aspects of the business, not the owners. All businesses that are considered for financing under SBA's 7(a) loan program must: meet SBA size standards, be for-profit, not already have the internal resources (business or personal) to provide the financing, and be able to demonstrate repayment. Certain variations of SBA's 7(a) loan program may also require additional eligibility criteria. Special purpose programs will identify those additional criteria.  </p>

    <ul> <li>    Operate for profit  </li>
      <li>    Be considered a small business, as defined by SBA  </li>
      <li>   Be engaged in, or propose to do business in, the United States or its possessions  </li>
      <li>   Have reasonable invested equity  </li>
      <li>   Use alternative financial resources, including personal assets, before seeking financial assistance  </li>
      <li>   Be able to demonstrate a need for a loan  </li>
      <li>   Use the funds for a sound business purpose  </li>
      <li>   Not be delinquent on any existing debt obligations to the U.S. government  </li> </ul>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
   <p> The maximum length of the loan is 25 years for real estate and seven years for working capital. The maximum loan amount is $5 million.</p>
<p> Loan repayment terms vary according to several factors: </p>

    <ul> <li>  Most 7(a) term loans are repaid with monthly payments of principal and interest </li>
      <li>  Payments stay the same for fixed-rate loans because the interest rate is constant </li>
      <li>  For variable rate loans, the lender can require a different payment amount when the interest rate changes </li> </ul>

    <br><h3>Using the 7(a) loan</h3>
    <p>Basic uses for the 7(a) loan include:</p>

    <ul> <li>    Long- and short-term working capital </li>
      <li>   Revolving funds based on the value of existing inventory and receivables </li>
      <li>   The purchase of equipment, machinery, furniture, fixtures, supplies, or materials </li>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Business and Industrial Loans</b></h2><br>

    <p> The purpose of the Business & Industrial (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program is to improve, develop, or finance business, industry, and employment and improve the economic and environmental climate in rural communities. </p>
    <br><p>This purpose is achieved by bolstering the existing private credit structure through the guarantee of quality loans which will provide lasting community benefits. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>A borrower may be:  </p>

    <ol>
      <li>   An individual   </li>
      <li>   A cooperative organization, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity organized and operated on a profit or nonprofit basis   </li>
      <li>   An Indian tribe on a Federal or state reservation or other Federally recognized tribal group, or   </li>
      <li>   A public body.   </li>
   </ol>

    <p>A borrower must be engaged in or proposing to engage in a business that will:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>      Provide employment </li>
      <li>      Improve the economic or environmental climate </li>
      <li>        Promote the conservation, development, and use of water for aquaculture, or  </li>
      <li>      Reduce reliance on nonrenewable energy resources by encouraging the development and construction of renewable energy systems. </li>
    </ul>

<p> Individual borrowers must be citizens of the United States or reside in the U.S. after being legally admitted for permanent residence. Corporations or other non-public body organization-type borrowers must be at least 51 percent owned by persons who are either citizens of the U.S. or reside in the U.S. after being legally admitted for permanent residence. B&I loans are normally available in rural areas.</p>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p>The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated between the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or variable as long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates are subject to Agency review and approval. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different intervals during the term of the loan, but the adjustments may not be more often than quarterly. </p>
<p>The annual renewal fee is paid once a year and is required to maintain the enforceability of the guarantee as to the lender. There is also an upfront guarantee fee of three percent. A limited amount of loans may be guaranteed with a two percent fee, subject to meeting regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>The maximum repayment for loans on real estate will not exceed 30 years; machinery and equipment repayment will not exceed the useful life of the machinery and equipment purchased with loan funds or 15 years, whichever is less; and working capital repayment will not exceed seven years.</p>
<p>The total amount of Agency loans to one borrower must not exceed $10 million. The Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception to the $10 million limit for loans of $25 million under certain circumstances. The Secretary may approve guaranteed loans in excess of $25 million, up to $40 million, for rural cooperative organizations that process value-added agricultural commodities.</p>

      <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Education Loan Consolidation</b></h2><br>

      <p>Consolidation Loans are available to most borrowers of Federal education loans and come from one of two sources:  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>  Direct Consolidation Loans are made by the U.S. Department of Education. You repay a Federal Consolidation Loan to the U.S. Department of Education. Federal Consolidation Loans are made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. No new loans are being made under the FFEL Program. All new loans, and therefore consolidation of those loans, are made under the Direct Loan Program. </li>
      <li>    Federal Consolidation Loans are made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. No new loans are being made under the FFEL Program. All new loans, and therefore consolidation of those loans, are made under the Direct Loan Program. </li>
    </ul>
      <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
      <p>Generally, you are eligible to consolidate after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment. Private educational loans are not eligible. Most Federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including:  </p>

      <ul>
        <li>    Direct Subsidized Loans  </li>
        <li>    Direct Unsubsidized Loans </li>
        <li>    Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans </li>
        <li>   Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans </li>
        <li>   Direct PLUS Loans </li>
        <li>   PLUS loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program </li>
        <li>   Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) </li>
        <li>   Federal Perkins Loans </li>
         <li>    Federal Nursing Loans </li>
        <li>   Health Education Assistance Loans </li>
        <li>    Some existing consolidation loans </li>
      </ul>
<p>A PLUS loan made to the parent of a dependent student cannot be transferred to the student through consolidation. Therefore, a student who is applying for loan consolidation cannot include the PLUS loan the parent took out for the dependent student’s education.</p>
    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>    Maximum Loan Amount: None </li>
      <li> Interest Rate: Weighted average interest rate on the loans being consolidated, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, not to exceed 8.25 percent. Currently, the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. For more information of the specific loan terms, please visit the Loan Consolidation home page. </li>
      <li> Maximum Loan Length: 10-30 years </li>
      <li>    Frequency of Payments: Varies </li>
      <li>  Prepayment penalties: None </li>
      <li> Fees: None </li> </ul>
<p> There is no application fee to complete a Direct Consolidation Loan application. You may be contacted by private companies that offer to help you consolidate your loans, for a fee. These companies have no affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) or ED's Federal Loan Servicers.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)</b></h2><br>

    <p> The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a tax credit to help pay for education expenses paid for the first four years of education completed after high school.  </p>
    <br><p> You can get a maximum annual credit of $2,500 per eligible student and 40% or $1,000 could be refunded if you owe no tax. This credit is subject to income limitations. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>To be eligible for AOTC, the student must:  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>     Be you, your spouse or your dependent that you listed on your tax return </li>
      <li>  Be pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential </li>
      <li>  Have qualified education expenses at an eligible educational institution </li>
      <li>  Be enrolled at least half time for at least one academic period* beginning in the tax year </li>
      <li>   Not have finished the first four years of higher education at the beginning of the tax year </li>
      <li>   Not have claimed the AOTC or the former Hope credit for more than four tax years </li>
      <li>    Not have a felony drug conviction at the end of the tax year </li> </ul>

    <br><h3>Income Limits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must be $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for married filing jointly).  </li>
      <li>  You receive a reduced amount of the credit if your MAGI is over $80,000 but less than $90,000 (over $160,000 but less than $180,000 for married filing jointly).  </li>
      <li>   You cannot claim the credit if your MAGI is over $90,000 ($180,000 for joint filers). </li> </ul>
   <p> MAGI for most people is the amount of AGI, adjusted gross income, shown on your tax return. If you file Form 1040, you add the following amounts to your AGI: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Foreign earned income exclusion, </li>
      <li>   Foreign housing exclusion, </li>
      <li>  Foreign housing deduction, </li>
      <li> Exclusion of income by bona fide residents of American Samoa, or of Puerto Rico. </li>
      <li>   If you need to adjust your AGI to find your MAGI, there are worksheets in the Publication 970PDF to help you. </li> </ul>

    <br><h3>Application</h3>
    <p> To claim AOTC, you must file a federal tax return, complete the Form 8863 and attach the completed form to your Form 1040 or Form 1040A. Use the information on the Form 1098-T Tuition Statement, received from the educational institution the student attended. The form includes the institution’s federal identification number, the student’s taxpayer identification number, payments received, amounts billed or refunds made for tuition and related expenses, scholarships administered by the institution, and the student’s enrollment and graduate status. </p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Home Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance</b></h2><br>

    <p> Section 203(k) insurance enables homebuyers and homeowners to finance both the purchase (or refinancing) of a house and the cost of its rehabilitation through a single mortgage or to finance the rehabilitation of their existing home. </p>
  <p>FHA's Limited 203(k) program permits homebuyers and homeowners to finance up to $35,000 into their mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade their home. Homebuyers and homeowners can quickly and easily tap into cash to pay for property repairs or improvements, such as those identified by a home inspector or an FHA appraiser. Homeowners can make property repairs, improvements, or prepare their home for sale.  Homebuyers can make their new home move-in ready by remodeling the kitchen, painting the interior or purchasing new carpet. </p>

    <br><h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Section 203(k) fills a unique and important need for homebuyers. When buying a house that needs repair or modernization, homebuyers usually have to follow a complicated and costly process. The interim acquisition and improvement loans often have relatively high interest rates, short repayment terms and a balloon payment. However, Section 203(k) offers a solution that helps both borrowers and lenders, insuring a single, long term, fixed or adjustable rate loan that covers both the acquisition and rehabilitation of a property. Section 203(k) insured loans save borrowers time and money. They also protect the lender by allowing them to have the loan insured even before the condition and value of the property may offer adequate security.</p>
<p>For less extensive repairs/improvements, see Limited 203(k). For housing rehabilitation activities that do not also require buying or refinancing the property, borrowers may also consider HUD's Title I Property Improvement Loan program.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>All persons who can make the monthly mortgage payments are eligible to apply. Cooperative units are not eligible.  </p>

    <br><h3>Type of Assistance</h3>
<p>Section 203(k) insures mortgages covering the purchase or refinancing and rehabilitation of a home that is at least a year old. A portion of the loan proceeds is used to pay the seller, or, if a refinance, to pay off the existing mortgage, and the remaining funds are placed in an escrow account and released as rehabilitation is completed. The cost of the rehabilitation must be at least $5,000, but the total value of the property must still fall within the FHA mortgage limit for the area. The value of the property is determined by either (1) the value of the property before rehabilitation plus the cost of rehabilitation, or (2) 110 percent of the appraised value of the property after rehabilitation, whichever is less.</p>
   <p>Many of the rules and restrictions that make FHA's basic single family mortgage insurance product (Section 203(b)) relatively convenient for lower income borrowers apply here. But lenders may charge some additional fees, such as a supplemental origination fee, fees to cover the preparation of architectural documents and review of the rehabilitation plan, and a higher appraisal fee. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligible Activities </h3>
    <p>The extent of the rehabilitation covered by Section 203(k) insurance may range from relatively minor (though exceeding $5000 in cost) to virtual reconstruction: a home that has been demolished or will be razed as part of rehabilitation is eligible, for example, provided that the existing foundation system remains in place. Section 203(k) insured loans can finance the rehabilitation of the residential portion of a property that also has non-residential uses; they can also cover the conversion of a property of any size to a one- to four- unit structure. The types of improvements that borrowers may make using Section 203(k) financing include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>    structural alterations and reconstruction </li>
      <li>    modernization and improvements to the home's function </li>
      <li>   elimination of health and safety hazards </li>
      <li>   changes that improve appearance and eliminate obsolescence </li>
      <li>  reconditioning or replacing plumbing; installing a well and/or septic system </li>
      <li> adding or replacing roofing, gutters, and downspouts </li>
      <li> adding or replacing floors and/or floor treatments </li>
      <li> major landscape work and site improvements </li>
      <li> enhancing accessibility for a disabled person </li>
      <li> making energy conservation improvements  </li> </ul>

    <p>HUD requires that properties financed under this program meet certain basic energy efficiency and structural standards. </p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Equity Investment - Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program </b></h2><br>

    <p> The SBA’s Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program seeks to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds to small businesses, which small business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization when such capital is not available in adequate supply. </p>
    <br><p>The SBA, through the SBIC program, licenses privately and publicly managed investment funds that raise capital from private investors and then combine it with capital obtained through the SBIC’s issuance of a taxpayer-backed debenture guaranteed by the SBA. The SBIC invests this combined capital in qualifying small businesses through terms established between the SBIC and small businesses within the parameters of the SBIC program regulations and SBA oversight. </p>
<p>Small businesses seeking capital from SBICs are typically later-stage, mature, profitable businesses that are generating cash flows sufficient to service interest and sometimes principal payments. SBIC small business financings are primarily in the form of subordinated debt with equity enhancements. SBIC financings to small businesses typically range from $2.5 million to $10 million. However, each SBIC has its own investment profile in terms of targeted industry, geography, company maturity, and the type and size of financing the SBIC will provide to small businesses. Small businesses interested in the possibility of receiving investment capital from an SBIC are encouraged to contact SBICs directly.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>To obtain SBIC financing, you should first identify and investigate existing SBICs that may be interested in financing your company. Use the SBIC directory as a first step in learning as much as possible about SBICs in your state, or in other areas important to your company's needs. In choosing an SBIC, consider the types of investments it makes, how much money is available for investment and how much might be available in the future. You should also consider whether the SBIC can offer you management services appropriate to your needs. Only companies defined by SBA as "small" are eligible for SBIC financing.  </p>

    <br><h3>Benefits of forming an SBIC</h3>
<p>In addition to having a positive impact on small businesses and the economy, the SBIC program offers multiple benefits to fund managers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>    Rapid fund deployment: The potential to capitalize as much as two-thirds of a fund with SBA leverage means managers spend less time fundraising and more time investing. </li>
      <li>  Flexible terms: The duration of SBA’s financing instruments can easily be matched up with short or long term investments. </li>
      <li>   Exempt from SEC registration: SBICs are exempt from SEC registration, yet LPs benefit from SBA’s careful monitoring of each fund’s performance and regulatory compliance. </li>
      <li>  Exempt from Volcker Rule: SBICs are exempt from the bank investment limitations set forth in the Volcker Rule as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. </li>
      <li>  Increased financial scale: SBA leverage allows funds to scale up their strategies and extend their financings to more businesses. </li>
      <li>   Enhanced returns potential: SBA-guaranteed capital is low cost and does not participate in profit. </li>
      <li>   CRA credit: Investments in SBICs are presumed to be a “qualified investment” for Community Reinvestment Act credit. </li>
    </ul>

    <br><h3>Characteristics of a successful SBIC</h3>
<p> Investment funds licensed as SBICs typically have four basic characteristics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Experienced management team: Team members have complementary skills and a history of working with each other. </li>
      <li> Proven investment strategy: Track records contain enough successful, income-generating investments to prove an ability to service SBA-guaranteed debt. </li>
      <li>  Track record of success: At least two team members’ 10-year track records clearly show success with investments analogous to the ones proposed for the SBIC. </li>
      <li>  Appealing fund structure: The SBIC’s structure aligns the incentives of the SBIC’s managers and investors. </li> </ol>
<p>SBICs must show that they can generate enough revenue to pay their SBIC debt obligations on a timely basis. This is particularly important for Standard Debenture and Impact SBIC applicants. Early Stage applicants should demonstrate multiple full, positive exits within four to six years of the investment date.</p>

    <br><h3>Regulations governing SBICs</h3>
<p>SBICs must invest: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> 75 percent of total capital in U.S. small businesses, defined as having the following:</li>
      <ul> <li>No more than 49% of employees overseas </li>
        <li>Less than $19.5 million of tangible net worth</li>
        <li>Less than $6.5 million of after-tax net income averaged over the previous two years</li></ul>
        <ul> <li> At least 25% of total capital in U.S. smaller enterprises, defined as having the following:</li>
<li>No more than 49% of employees overseas</li>
          <li>Less than $6 million of tangible net worth</li>
          <li>Less than $2 million of after-tax net income averaged over the previous two years</li> </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>SBICs may not invest in: </p>
    <ul>
  <li>   U.S. small businesses with more than 49% of employees overseas </li>
      <li>    Real estate </li>
      <li>   Project finance </li>
      <li>   Re-lenders </li>
      <li>   More than 10% of investable capital in any one business </li>

      <li>   Certain surviving spouses </li>
    </ul>
<p>To be eligible, the Veteran/Servicemember must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and meet the length of service requirements.</p>
 <p>As a requirement for a VA home loan, the Veteran, the Veterans' spouse, or dependent child must certify occupancy for the property.</p>
    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p>Market Interest Rate, VA funding fee, and no pre-payment penalties. Maximum loan term cannot exceed 30 years. No maximum loan amount.</p>

    <br><h2>Interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL)</h2>
<p>If you have an existing VA-backed home loan and you want to reduce your monthly mortgage payments—or make your payments more stable—an interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL) may be right for you. Refinancing lets you replace your current loan with a new one under different terms.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>You may be eligible for an IRRRL if you meet all of these requirements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>  You already have a VA-backed home loan, and </li>
      <li> You’re using the IRRRL to refinance your existing VA-backed home loan, and </li>
      <li>  You can certify that you currently live in or used to live in the home covered by the loan </li>   </ul>
    <br><h3>Why IRRRL?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower your monthly mortgage payment by getting you a lower interest rate, or <li>
      <li>   Make your monthly payments more stable by moving from a loan with an adjustable or variable interest rate (an interest rate that changes over time) to one that’s fixed (the same interest rate over the life of the loan) </li> </ul>
   <p>   On a no-down-payment loan, you can borrow up to the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac conforming loan limit in most areas—and more in some high-cost counties. You can borrow more than this amount if you want to make a down payment. </p>
  <p> You’ll want to keep closing costs in mind when refinancing a loan, as they can add up to thousands of dollars. Before you decide to refinance, divide your closing costs by how much you expect to save every month by refinancing to see if it’s worth it. While your lender can advise you on the costs and benefits of the transaction, you’ll want to be sure you understand what you’re getting into.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Direct PLUS Loans</b></h2><br>

    <p> Direct PLUS Loans are unsubsidized loans for the parents of dependent students and for graduate/professional students. PLUS Loans help pay for education expenses up to the cost of attendance minus all other financial assistance. Interest is charged during all periods. </p>
    <br><p>The school applies PLUS loan funds toward your child's educational costs such as tuition, fees, and room and board. If any loan funds remain after school charges are paid, you will receive the remaining amount from the school, unless you authorized the school to release the funds to your child. Any funds you or your child receives must be used to pay the child's educational expenses. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>To qualify for this program, you must:  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>    Be a parent of a dependent postsecondary student who is working toward a postsecondary degree or certificate; and </li>
      <li>   Not have an adverse credit history.</li> </ul>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p>Maximum Loan Amount: Your child's cost of attendance minus other financial aid. For example, if your child's cost of attendance is $6,000, and he or she receives $4,000 in other financial aid, you can borrow up to $2,000 in PLUS Loans.</p>
<p>Interest Rate: The interest rate is variable (does not exceed 8.25%) (adjusted annually on July 1), but it does not exceed nine percent. You'll be notified any time the variable rate changes. For the current PLUS Loan interest rate, visit the PLUS Loan information page.  </p>
<p>Maximum Loan Length: Up to 30 years, depending on the amount borrowed and the repayment plan chosen. There are a number of repayment plans offered through the Direct and FFEL programs. Read How to Repay Your Loans online for more information about repayment.</p>
<p>Frequency of Payments: Monthly or quarterly. Generally, the first payment is due within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed. You must begin repaying both principal and interest while the student is in school.</p>
 <p>Prepayment Penalties: None</p>
    <p>Fees: You will pay a fee of up to four percent of the loan, deducted proportionately each time a loan disbursement is made. Because of this deduction, you'll receive slightly less than the amount you're borrowing.</p>

    <br><h3>Apply</h3>
<p>If your child's school participates in the Direct Loan program, you can obtain a Direct PLUS Loan application from your child's school. To apply for a FFEL PLUS Loan, you can get an application through your child's school, from a lender that participates in the FFEL program, or from the guaranty agency in your state.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Financial Aid Programs</b></h2><br>

    <p>Federal Perkins Loans help financially needy undergraduate and graduate students meet the cost of postsecondary education. The award is made by the school based on the availability of funds. A Federal Perkins Loan carries a fixed interest rate and must be repaid beginning after a nine-month grace period following the date when the student is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis.  </p>
    <br><p>Institutional financial aid administrators at participating institutions have substantial flexibility in determining the amount of Perkins loans to award to students who are enrolled or accepted for enrollment. Borrowers who undertake certain public, military, or teaching service employment are eligible to have all or part of their loans canceled. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>To be eligible for a Perkins Loan, applicants must be all of the following:  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>    An undergraduate, graduate, or professional student with exceptional financial need  </li>
      <li> Enrolled full-time or part-time  </li>
      <li> Attending a school that participates in the Federal Perkins Loan Program  </li>
    </ul>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p>Maximum Loan Amounts: Undergraduate - up to $5,500 a year (maximum of $27,500 as an undergraduate)
      Graduate - up to $8,000 a year (maximum of $60,000, including undergraduate loans)
      Amount actually received depends on financial need, amount of other aid, and availability of funds at school</p>
<p>Interest Rate: Fixed at five percent</p>
<p>Maximum Loan Length: Perkins Loan repayment plan options differ from Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loans. Check with your school for more information on Perkins loans repayment.</p>
<p>Frequency of Payments: Monthly or quarterly. After you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment, you have a nine-month grace period before you begin repayment. Those in the military might have longer.</p>
<p>Prepayment penalties: None</p>
    <br><h3>Apply</h3>
    <p>To apply for Perkins Loans, fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online (the faster and easier way), or you can get a paper FAFSA from your high school, local library, postsecondary school, or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243). </p>
   <p>If you applied for Federal student aid for the previous school year, you can probably file a Renewal FAFSA for the next year. By using a Renewal FAFSA, you will only have to update any information that has changed and fill in a few new answers.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>  Loan Management</b></h2><br>

    <p>For Veterans or Servicemembers who have a VA-guaranteed conventional or sub-prime loan, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a network of eight Regional Loan Centers that can offer advice and guidance during times of financial hardship.  </p>
    <br><p> Borrowers may visit the Home Loans Information page, or call toll free -1-877-827-3702 to speak with a VA Loan Technician. However, unlike when a Veteran has a VA-guaranteed home loan, VA does not have the authority to intervene on the borrower's behalf for conventional loans. It is imperative that a borrower contact his/her mortgage servicer as quickly as possible when faced with financial hardship.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>  Persons who may qualify for VA-guaranteed loans include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>    Veterans  </li>
      <li>     Reserve and National Guard Members (called to active duty)  </li>
      <li>    Active duty Servicemembers  </li>
      <li>   Current Reserve and Guard members (after six years of creditable service)  </li>
      <li>   Certain surviving spouses  </li>
    </ul>
<p>Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are considered to be active duty members and Veterans, once discharged.</p>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
   <p> The mortgage servicer has the primary responsibility for servicing the VA-guaranteed loan to resolve the default. When VA decides additional information or action is needed, VA initiates contact with the Veteran to offer financial counseling, discuss loss mitigation options that have been considered, and sometimes serve as an intermediary between the Veteran and mortgage servicer to negotiate a resolution to the default. VA then helps the servicer and the borrower to arrange an appropriate loss mitigation option, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Repayment Plan: The Veteran may pay a regular payment plus part of the delinquency each month over a period of time until the loan is brought current; </li>
      <li> Special Forbearance: Temporarily suspend payments to allow the Veteran time to sell the property or reinstate the loan; </li>
      <li>  Loan Modification: Provide the Veteran a fresh start by adding the delinquency to the loan balance and establishing a new payment schedule; </li>
      <li>   Refunding: VA can consider refunding (purchasing) the loan and modifying it to make the payments more affordable to the Veteran; </li>
        <li>   Compromise Sale / Short Sale: The Veteran sells their home for an amount less than what is owed at current market value with VA paying the difference, up to the maximum guaranty on the loan; or </li>
      <li>   Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure: The Veteran voluntarily deeds the property to the servicer to avoid the foreclosure process, with VA paying the difference between the payoff and the net property value. </li>
    </ul>
