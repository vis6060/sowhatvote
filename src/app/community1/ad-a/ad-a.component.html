      <ul> <li>    Unlike the AIDS and Clinical subcategories, the General subcategory is not targeted toward a specific area (e.g., AIDS) or type (e.g., clinical) of research. Rather, the focus is on attracting and retaining highly talented investigators to pursue biomedical research studies and investigations in a variety of scientific disciplines. Generally, this subcategory is used to attract or retain more senior researchers rather than trainees. For the General subcategory, a "qualified research assignment" is one that is approved by the LRC based on the nature of the proposed research and its relationship to the mission and priorities of NIH.</li>
      <li>    Domestic, nonprofit research funding (Extramural programs only) - Your research must be supported by a domestic, nonprofit foundation, university, professional association, or other nonprofit institution, or a U.S. government agency (Federal, State, or local). A domestic foundation, professional association, or institution is considered to be nonprofit if it is exempt from Federal tax under the provisions of Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501). NIH grants and university salaries are considered eligible funding. Your employment must be with a domestic, nonprofit institution. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>     NIH Employment (Intramural programs only) - You must be an NIH employee or have a firm commitment of employment from an authorized official of the NIH. Appointments are made under the broad authority of the Federal Civil Service (Title V or Title 42) or the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service. Responsibility for obtaining qualifying employment rests with the LRP applicant. </p>

      <br><h3> Additional Eligbility</h3>
      <p>In addition to the general eligibility requirements, you must be a qualified health professional with a doctorate degree (e.g. M.D., ph.D., Dr. PH.) who is employed in non-federal academic/research settings and are able to conduct two years of minority health disparities or other health disparities research or clinical research.  </p>

      <br><h3>Ineligbility Criteria</h3>
      <p>     You are ineligible to apply for the NIH LRPs if you are: </p>

      <p>    An individual who is not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident of the U.S. by the LRP award start date; </p>
      <p>    An individual who has or had a Federal judgment lien against his/her property arising from Federal debt; </p>
      <p>   An individual who owes an obligation of health professional service to the federal government, a state, or other entity, unless deferrals or extensions are granted for the length of the NIH LRP contract; </p>
      <p>   An individual employed by a federal government agency, other than NIH, with a work schedule of more than 20 hours per week; </p>

      <p>  An individual who does not meet the 20% debt-to-income ratio. </p>

      <br><h3>Loan Eligbility Criteria</h3>
      <p>NIH will repay your lenders for qualified educational loans issued by any U.S. government entity, accredited U.S. academic institutions, and/or commercial lenders that are subject to examination and supervision in their capacity as lending institutions by an agency of the United States or the state in which the lender has its principal place of business.  </p>
      <p>Qualified educational loans are loans that were used for school tuition or other reasonable educational or living expenses (including room/board and transportation) while attending undergraduate, graduate, medical, dental, or veterinary schools. LRP awards are not retroactive, thus loan balances paid down or paid-in-full prior to the start date of an LRP award will not be factored in the calculation of an award. NIH also will not repay any late fees, penalty fees, additional interest charges, or collection costs.  </p>

    <p> The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan program guarantees loans made to eligible Veterans, Servicemembers, Reservists, National Guard members and certain surviving spouses. </p>
    <br><p>VA guarantees a percentage of the loan. This helps the Veteran obtain a no-down payment mortgage at a competitive interest rate that does not require private mortgage insurance. </p>
    <p>VA-guaranteed loans may also be refinanced. Go to Home Loan Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing to see the program requirements.  To obtain the most advantageous financing, VA encourages eligible Veterans, Servicemembers, Reservists, and National Guard members to meet with several lenders to determine the best mortgage terms to meet individual needs and circumstances.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>Persons who may qualify for VA-guaranteed loans include:  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>   Veterans </li>
      <li>   Reserve and National Guard members (called to active duty) </li>
      <li>   Active duty Servicemembers </li>
      <li>   Current Reserve and Guard members (after six years of creditable service) </li>
      <li>   Certain surviving spouses </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be eligible, the Veteran/Servicemember must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and meet the length of service requirements.</p>
    <p>As a requirement for a VA home loan, the Veteran, the Veterans' spouse, or dependent child must certify occupancy for the property.</p>
    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p>Market Interest Rate, VA funding fee, and no pre-payment penalties. Maximum loan term cannot exceed 30 years. No maximum loan amount.</p>

    <br><h2>Interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL)</h2>
    <p>If you have an existing VA-backed home loan and you want to reduce your monthly mortgage payments—or make your payments more stable—an interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL) may be right for you. Refinancing lets you replace your current loan with a new one under different terms.</p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>You may be eligible for an IRRRL if you meet all of these requirements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>  You already have a VA-backed home loan, and </li>
      <li> You’re using the IRRRL to refinance your existing VA-backed home loan, and </li>
      <li>  You can certify that you currently live in or used to live in the home covered by the loan </li>   </ul>
    <br><h3>Why IRRRL?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower your monthly mortgage payment by getting you a lower interest rate, or <li>
      <li>   Make your monthly payments more stable by moving from a loan with an adjustable or variable interest rate (an interest rate that changes over time) to one that’s fixed (the same interest rate over the life of the loan) </li> </ul>
    <p>   On a no-down-payment loan, you can borrow up to the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac conforming loan limit in most areas—and more in some high-cost counties. You can borrow more than this amount if you want to make a down payment. </p>
    <p> You’ll want to keep closing costs in mind when refinancing a loan, as they can add up to thousands of dollars. Before you decide to refinance, divide your closing costs by how much you expect to save every month by refinancing to see if it’s worth it. While your lender can advise you on the costs and benefits of the transaction, you’ll want to be sure you understand what you’re getting into.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Microloan Program</b></h2><br>

    <p> The MicroLoan Program provides very small loans to start-up, newly established, or growing small business concerns and certain not-for-profit childcare centers. </p>
    <br><p>Under this program, SBA makes funds available to nonprofit community based lenders (Microlender Intermediaries) which, in turn, make loans to eligible borrowers in amounts up to a maximum of $50,000. The average loan size is about $13,000. Applications are submitted to the local intermediary and all credit decisions are made on the local level. </p>
    <br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CYWkZhVbDo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p> Each intermediary lender has its own lending and credit requirements. However, business owners contemplating application for a microloan should be aware that intermediaries will generally require some type of collateral, and the personal guarantee of the business owner. </p>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p> The maximum term allowed for a microloan is six years. However, loan terms vary according to the size of the loan, the planned use of funds, the requirements of the intermediary lender, and the needs of the small business borrower. Interest rates vary, depending upon the intermediary lender and costs to the intermediary from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
    <br><h3>Apply Process</h3>
    <p> Small businesses interested in the Microloan Program should contact a Intermediary Microlender in their area. A Microlender is a non profit organization that receives a loan from SBA. In turn, the Microlender makes small loans to very small businesses in the community. The Microlender also provides technical assistance to the small business. All credit decisions are made by the Microlender. The application process may vary depending on the Intermediary Microlender.</p>
    <br><h3>Using the Microloan</h3>
    <p>Microloans can be used for a variety of purposes that help small businesses expand. Use them when you need less than $50,000 to rebuild, re-open, repair, enhance, or improve your small business. Examples include: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>   Working capital </li>
      <li>  Inventory </li>
      <li>  Supplies </li>
      <li>  Furniture </li>
      <li>   Fixtures </li>
      <li>  Machinery </li>
      <li>  Equipment </li>
     </ul>
<p> Proceeds from an SBA microloan cannot be used to pay existing debts or to purchase real estate.</p>
    <br><h3>Loan Repayment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>    Amount, planned use, lender requirements, needs of the small business owner </li>
      <li>   Maximum repayment term allowed for an SBA microloan is six years </li>
      <li>   Interest rates vary depending on the intermediary lender </li>
      <li>   Generally, between 8 and 13 percent </li> </ol>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> DOT’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program</b></h2><br>

    <p> The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. </p>
    <br><p>  Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.   </p>
    <br><p> SBIR Mission and Program Goals  </p>

    <p> The mission of the SBIR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The program’s goals are four-fold:  </p>
