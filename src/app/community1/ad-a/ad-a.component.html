      <br><h3> General Eligbility</h3>
      <p>  Citizenship - You must be a U.S. citizen, U.S national, or permanent resident of the U.S. by the LRP award start date. </p>

      <p>  Qualifying Degree (Extramural programs only) - Possess an M.D., Ph.D., Pharm.D., Psy.D., D.O., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.P.M., D.C., N.D., O.D., D.V.M., or equivalent doctoral degree from an accredited institution. There are some exceptions in the Contraception and Infertility and REACH subcategories. Visit the Contraception and Infertility and REACH pages for additional details. </p>

      <p>  Qualifying Degree (Intramural programs only) - Possess an M.D., Ph.D., D.O., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.P.M., D.V.M., A.D.N., B.S.N., or equivalent doctoral degree from an accredited institution; or hold the position of Physician Assistant. </p>

      <p>  Qualified Educational Debt - You must have total qualified educational debt equal to or in excess of 20 percent of your institutional base salary at the time of award. Institutional base salary is the annual amount you are paid for your appointment, whether the time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Institutional base salary excludes any income that you may earn outside of the duties of the organization. It is not necessary for renewal applicants to satisfy the 20 percent debt-to-income requirement. </p>

      <p>  Qualified Research (Extramural programs only) - You must agree to conduct only research that is not prohibited by Federal law, regulations, or policies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or National Institutes of Health (NIH). If you receive an LRP award, you must conduct your research in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local law (e.g., applicable human subject protection regulations) for the entire contract period. Additionally, you must engage in qualified research for an average of at least 20 hours per week during each quarterly service period of your LRP award. </p>

      <p>  Qualified Research Assignments (Intramural programs only) - You must be appointed at the NIH in a qualified research area. </p>

      <p>  For the AIDS and Clinical Research for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds subcategories, qualified research assignments must involve AIDS or clinical research and be approved by the Loan Repayment Committee (LRC). In support of the objectives of these subcategories, if applicable, an individual who is already employed by the NIH and applies to the Intramural LRP must demonstrate his/her ability and intention to transfer from a non-qualified to a qualified AIDS or clinical research assignment. </p>
      <ul> <li>    Unlike the AIDS and Clinical subcategories, the General subcategory is not targeted toward a specific area (e.g., AIDS) or type (e.g., clinical) of research. Rather, the focus is on attracting and retaining highly talented investigators to pursue biomedical research studies and investigations in a variety of scientific disciplines. Generally, this subcategory is used to attract or retain more senior researchers rather than trainees. For the General subcategory, a "qualified research assignment" is one that is approved by the LRC based on the nature of the proposed research and its relationship to the mission and priorities of NIH.</li>
      <li>    Domestic, nonprofit research funding (Extramural programs only) - Your research must be supported by a domestic, nonprofit foundation, university, professional association, or other nonprofit institution, or a U.S. government agency (Federal, State, or local). A domestic foundation, professional association, or institution is considered to be nonprofit if it is exempt from Federal tax under the provisions of Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501). NIH grants and university salaries are considered eligible funding. Your employment must be with a domestic, nonprofit institution. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>     NIH Employment (Intramural programs only) - You must be an NIH employee or have a firm commitment of employment from an authorized official of the NIH. Appointments are made under the broad authority of the Federal Civil Service (Title V or Title 42) or the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service. Responsibility for obtaining qualifying employment rests with the LRP applicant. </p>

      <br><h3> Additional Eligbility</h3>
      <p>In addition to the general eligibility requirements, you must be a qualified health professional with a doctorate degree (e.g. M.D., ph.D., Dr. PH.) who is employed in non-federal academic/research settings and are able to conduct two years of minority health disparities or other health disparities research or clinical research.  </p>

      <br><h3>Ineligbility Criteria</h3>
      <p>     You are ineligible to apply for the NIH LRPs if you are: </p>

      <p>    An individual who is not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident of the U.S. by the LRP award start date; </p>
      <p>    An individual who has or had a Federal judgment lien against his/her property arising from Federal debt; </p>
      <p>   An individual who owes an obligation of health professional service to the federal government, a state, or other entity, unless deferrals or extensions are granted for the length of the NIH LRP contract; </p>
      <p>   An individual employed by a federal government agency, other than NIH, with a work schedule of more than 20 hours per week; </p>
      <p>   An individual who receives any research funding support or salary from a for-profit institution or organization, including an individual identified as a Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI in an industry/pharma-supported Clinical Trial; </p>
      <p>   A current recipient of an NIH Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) or a Cancer Research Training Award (CRTA); </p>
      <p>  An individual conducting research for which funding is precluded by Federal law, Federal regulations, or HHS/NIH policy, or that does not comply with applicable Federal, State, and local law regarding the conduct of the research (e.g., applicable human subject protection regulations); </p>
      <p>  An individual who does not meet the 20% debt-to-income ratio. </p>

      <br><h3>Loan Eligbility Criteria</h3>
      <p>NIH will repay your lenders for qualified educational loans issued by any U.S. government entity, accredited U.S. academic institutions, and/or commercial lenders that are subject to examination and supervision in their capacity as lending institutions by an agency of the United States or the state in which the lender has its principal place of business.  </p>
      <p>Qualified educational loans are loans that were used for school tuition or other reasonable educational or living expenses (including room/board and transportation) while attending undergraduate, graduate, medical, dental, or veterinary schools. LRP awards are not retroactive, thus loan balances paid down or paid-in-full prior to the start date of an LRP award will not be factored in the calculation of an award. NIH also will not repay any late fees, penalty fees, additional interest charges, or collection costs.  </p>

Additionally, you must engage in qualified research for an average of at least 20 hours per week during each quarterly service period of your LRP award. </p>

    <p>  Qualified Research Assignments (Intramural programs only) - You must be appointed at the NIH in a qualified research area. </p>

    <p>  For the AIDS and Clinical Research for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds subcategories, qualified research assignments must involve AIDS or clinical research and be approved by the Loan Repayment Committee (LRC). In support of the objectives of these subcategories, if applicable, an individual who is already employed by the NIH and applies to the Intramural LRP must demonstrate his/her ability and intention to transfer from a non-qualified to a qualified AIDS or clinical research assignment. </p>
    <ul> <li>    Unlike the AIDS and Clinical subcategories, the General subcategory is not targeted toward a specific area (e.g., AIDS) or type (e.g., clinical) of research. Rather, the focus is on attracting and retaining highly talented investigators to pursue biomedical research studies and investigations in a variety of scientific disciplines. Generally, this subcategory is used to attract or retain more senior researchers rather than trainees. For the General subcategory, a "qualified research assignment" is one that is approved by the LRC based on the nature of the proposed research and its relationship to the mission and priorities of NIH.</li>
      <li>    Domestic, nonprofit research funding (Extramural programs only) - Your research must be supported by a domestic, nonprofit foundation, university, professional association, or other nonprofit institution, or a U.S. government agency (Federal, State, or local). A domestic foundation, professional association, or institution is considered to be nonprofit if it is exempt from Federal tax under the provisions of Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501). NIH grants and university salaries are considered eligible funding. Your employment must be with a domestic, nonprofit institution. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>     NIH Employment (Intramural programs only) - You must be an NIH employee or have a firm commitment of employment from an authorized official of the NIH. Appointments are made under the broad authority of the Federal Civil Service (Title V or Title 42) or the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service. Responsibility for obtaining qualifying employment rests with the LRP applicant. </p>

    <br><h3> Additional Eligbility</h3>
    <p>In addition to the general eligibility requirements, you must be a qualified health professional with a doctorate degree (e.g. M.D., ph.D., Dr. PH.) who is employed in non-federal academic/research settings and are able to conduct two years of minority health disparities or other health disparities research or clinical research.  </p>

    <br><h3>Ineligbility Criteria</h3>
    <p>     You are ineligible to apply for the NIH LRPs if you are: </p>

    <p>    An individual who is not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident of the U.S. by the LRP award start date; </p>
    <p>    An individual who has or had a Federal judgment lien against his/her property arising from Federal debt; </p>
    <p>   An individual who owes an obligation of health professional service to the federal government, a state, or other entity, unless deferrals or extensions are granted for the length of the NIH LRP contract; </p>
    <p>   An individual employed by a federal government agency, other than NIH, with a work schedule of more than 20 hours per week; </p>
    <p>   An individual who receives any research funding support or salary from a for-profit institution or organization, including an individual identified as a Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI in an industry/pharma-supported Clinical Trial; </p>
    <p>   A current recipient of an NIH Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) or a Cancer Research Training Award (CRTA); </p>
    <p>  An individual conducting research for which funding is precluded by Federal law, Federal regulations, or HHS/NIH policy, or that does not comply with applicable Federal, State, and local law regarding the conduct of the research (e.g., applicable human subject protection regulations); </p>
    <p>  An individual who does not meet the 20% debt-to-income ratio. </p>

    <br><h3>Loan Eligbility Criteria</h3>
    <p>NIH will repay your lenders for qualified educational loans issued by any U.S. government entity, accredited U.S. academic institutions, and/or commercial lenders that are subject to examination and supervision in their capacity as lending institutions by an agency of the United States or the state in which the lender has its principal place of business.  </p>
    <p>Qualified educational loans are loans that were used for school tuition or other reasonable educational or living expenses (including room/board and transportation) while attending undergraduate, graduate, medical, dental, or veterinary schools. LRP awards are not retroactive, thus loan balances paid down or paid-in-full prior to the start date of an LRP award will not be factored in the calculation of an award. NIH also will not repay any late fees, penalty fees, additional interest charges, or collection costs.  </p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"><b> Microloan Program</b></h2><br>

    <p> The MicroLoan Program provides very small loans to start-up, newly established, or growing small business concerns and certain not-for-profit childcare centers. </p>
    <br><p>Under this program, SBA makes funds available to nonprofit community based lenders (Microlender Intermediaries) which, in turn, make loans to eligible borrowers in amounts up to a maximum of $50,000. The average loan size is about $13,000. Applications are submitted to the local intermediary and all credit decisions are made on the local level. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p> Each intermediary lender has its own lending and credit requirements. However, business owners contemplating application for a microloan should be aware that intermediaries will generally require some type of collateral, and the personal guarantee of the business owner. </p>

    <br><h3>Loan Terms</h3>
    <p> The maximum term allowed for a microloan is six years. However, loan terms vary according to the size of the loan, the planned use of funds, the requirements of the intermediary lender, and the needs of the small business borrower. Interest rates vary, depending upon the intermediary lender and costs to the intermediary from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
    <br><h3>Apply Process</h3>
    <p> Small businesses interested in the Microloan Program should contact a Intermediary Microlender in their area. A Microlender is a non profit organization that receives a loan from SBA. In turn, the Microlender makes small loans to very small businesses in the community. The Microlender also provides technical assistance to the small business. All credit decisions are made by the Microlender. The application process may vary depending on the Intermediary Microlender.</p>
    <br><h3>Using the Microloan</h3>
    <p>Microloans can be used for a variety of purposes that help small businesses expand. Use them when you need less than $50,000 to rebuild, re-open, repair, enhance, or improve your small business. Examples include: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>   Working capital </li>
      <li>  Inventory </li>
      <li>  Supplies </li>
      <li>  Furniture </li>
      <li>   Fixtures </li>
      <li>  Machinery </li>
      <li>  Equipment </li>
     </ul>
<p> Proceeds from an SBA microloan cannot be used to pay existing debts or to purchase real estate.</p>
    <br><h3>Loan Repayment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>    Amount, planned use, lender requirements, needs of the small business owner </li>
      <li>   Maximum repayment term allowed for an SBA microloan is six years </li>
      <li>   Interest rates vary depending on the intermediary lender </li>
      <li>   Generally, between 8 and 13 percent </li> </ol>

    <p> The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. </p>
    <br><p>  Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.   </p>
    <br><p> SBIR Mission and Program Goals  </p>

    <p> The mission of the SBIR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The programâ€™s goals are four-fold:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>  Stimulate technological innovation. </li>
      <li>  Meet Federal research and development needs. </li>
      <li>  Foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons. </li>
      <li>   Increase private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development funding. </li>
    </ul>

    <br><p>Three-Phase Program:The SBIR Program is structured in three phases:  </p>

  <p> Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to providing further Federal support in Phase II. SBIR Phase I awards normally do not exceed $150,000 total costs for 6 months. </p>
    <p>   Phase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R/R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Only Phase I awardees are eligible for a Phase II award. SBIR Phase II awards normally do not exceed $1,000,000 total costs for 2 years. </p>
    <p> Phase III. The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II R/R&D activities. The SBIR program does not fund Phase III. Phase III may involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&D or production contracts for products, processes or services intended for use by the U.S. Government. </p>

    <br><h3>Eligbility</h3>
    <p>Only United States small businesses are eligible to participate in the SBIR program. Businesses must meet all of the following criteria at the time of Phase I and II awards:  </p>
